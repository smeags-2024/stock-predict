# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. The following versions are currently supported with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it by emailing our security team.

### Please do not:
- Open a public GitHub issue
- Discuss the vulnerability in public forums
- Attempt to exploit the vulnerability

### Please do:
- Email security details to our private security contact
- Provide as much information as possible about the vulnerability
- Allow us reasonable time to address the issue before public disclosure

## Security Measures

### Code Security
- All code is automatically scanned for vulnerabilities using static analysis tools
- Dependencies are regularly updated and scanned for known vulnerabilities
- Security-focused code reviews are performed for all changes

### Build Security  
- All builds are performed in isolated environments
- Build artifacts are cryptographically signed
- Supply chain security is maintained through dependency pinning

### Runtime Security
- Input validation on all external data sources
- Memory safety through RAII and smart pointers
- Safe integer arithmetic to prevent overflow vulnerabilities
- Secure random number generation for cryptographic operations

### Network Security
- All network communications use TLS encryption
- API authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input sanitization for all network inputs

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

1. **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
2. **Day 1-3**: Initial assessment and acknowledgment
3. **Day 4-14**: Investigation and patch development
4. **Day 15-30**: Patch testing and validation
5. **Day 31**: Security advisory published and patch released

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Installation Security
- Always download releases from official sources
- Verify cryptographic signatures of downloaded packages
- Use system package managers when available (apt, yum, brew)
- Keep dependencies updated to latest secure versions

### Configuration Security
- Use strong, unique API keys for data sources
- Store sensitive configuration in environment variables
- Regularly rotate API keys and credentials
- Follow principle of least privilege for system access

### Runtime Security
- Run with minimal required permissions
- Use containerization for isolation
- Monitor system resources and network activity
- Implement proper logging and monitoring

### Data Security
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use secure communication channels for data transmission
- Implement proper access controls for data files
- Regular backup and secure storage of important data

## Security Features

### Memory Safety
- Extensive use of RAII and smart pointers
- Bounds checking on array access
- Safe string operations
- Automatic resource management

### Input Validation
- Comprehensive validation of market data inputs
- Sanitization of user-provided configuration
- Range checking on numerical inputs
- Format validation for date/time inputs

### Error Handling
- Secure error messages that don't leak sensitive information
- Proper exception handling to prevent crashes
- Graceful degradation on security failures
- Audit logging of security-relevant events

### Cryptographic Security
- Use of well-established cryptographic libraries
- Secure random number generation
- Proper key management practices
- Regular security audits of cryptographic implementations
